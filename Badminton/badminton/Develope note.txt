A. Hard Requirement : 

1. We NEED to play in the same court, so continuous 2 hours with 2 different court is not what we want.

2. Continuous 2hours-play time is fixed, so we need to check if same court can be booked by coutinuous 2 hours.

3. There is 3 section of time interval, 06:00-12:00, 12:00-18:00 and 18:00-22:00,there is no requirement to book accross two time interval.

B. Perform step : 

1. Input SessionID, Target Date and Target Time.

2. curl_easy_perform to download the specific website html source code according to date USER input.
   in order to parse the html code and check if any court we can book.
   (Using for-loop to get all of them at the same time.)

3. Perform parsing job to analysis which court we can book in the same date, this also need a for loop to check for all dates' html information.

4. In the same for loop, if we found the target, input all the parameter to curl the booking website, which is on top of this file.
   Noted that I will try the pattern that book immediately after we found the target, to increase the rate of successful.
   
5. Program will be performed for specific loop(or specific time) to let User can activate before the booking information is refresh.

C. Tips

1. In order to trigger the booking, we need to make sure all the redirection accessed behind the explorer is followed.
   Thus we might need "CURLOPT_FOLLOWLOCATION" parameter to follow the redirection.
   
2. In order to get into the website with Login status, we will need to import related cookie that can represent the login status.
   Thus, we might need "CURLOPT_COOKIE" to send the pre-required cookie(get from chrome) to let server know that we are now login.
